# Setting up your Raspberry Pi

1. First we are going to add the heat sinks to the Raspberry Pi (going forward it will be referred to as the Pi.)
    a. As you can see, your Pi comes with 3 heat sinks designed to keep **[INSERT 3 COMPONENTS HEAT SINKS ARE USED ON]** cool. The below picture labels where each heat sink belongs on the Pi.

    </div>

    b. Place Pi guard #3 as pictured below on the pi to help place the heat sinks on the Pi.

    </span>
    </div>

    c. After placing the heat sinks on the Pi, you should see the folling:

    </div>

> Heat sinks keep the Pi cool to prevent it from overheating.

2. Insert the microSD card into the port on the bottom of the Pi.

3. Remove the washers from the back of the display monitor. Make sure to keep these in a safe spot as they will be needed later.

4. Place Pi guard #1 on the back of the display as shown below:

    </span>
    </div>

5. Place the Pi on top of the guard on the back of the display monitor.
    * The ethernet and USB ports should be facing away from the middle of the display.
