<div align=center><h1>Software and Operating Systems</h1></div>

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the following concepts:

- What is software?
- What is an operating system?
- What are the core functions of an operating system?
- What are some examples of operating systems?

<div align=center><h2>What is Software</h2></div>

In the last lesson, we learned that computer systems consist of two major elements: hardware and software. In this lesson, you are going to learn about software.

**Software** is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. Opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer, software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device.

Software is often divided into two categories:

- System Software: operating systems and any program that supports application software.
- Application Software: user-downloaded programs that fulfill a want or need

<div align=center><h2>What is an Operating System?</h2></div>

Now that you understand how a computer works at a basic level, we will explore how an operating system makes hardware available to applications on the computer.

An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn’t function.

<div align=center><h2>Core Funcitons of an Operating System</h2></div>

An operating system has three main functions:

1. Managing computer resources
2. Establishing user interfaces
3. Supporting applications software

<div align=center><h3>1. Managing Computer Resources</h3></div>

**Key Terms**
- **Processor Management**
- **Memory Management**
- **Device Management**
- **Storage Management**

**Processor management** involves putting the tasks into order and pairing them into manageable size before they go to the CPU.
**Memory management** coordinates data to and from RAM (random-access memory) and determines the necessity for virtual memory.
**Device management** provides interface between connected devices.
**Storage management** directs permanent data storage.

<div align=center><h3>2. Establishing User Interfaces</h3></div>

**Key Terms**
- **Graphical User Interface**
- **Command Line Interface**

<div align=center><h3>3. Supporting Application Software</h3></div>

**Key Terms**
- **Applications**

<div align=center><h4>Examples of Operating Systems</h4></div>

Various operating systems are found on computing devices. These are a few different types of computers that run unique operating systems:

- Desktops/Laptops

In the next part of the lesson we will be reviewing a few examples of desktop operating systems.

<div align=center><h4>Microsoft Windows</h4></div>

**Key Terms**
- **Microsoft Windows**

**Microsoft Windows** is a group of OSs manufactured by Microsoft. Microsoft Windows is the most widely used desktop operating system. This is because Windows comes preloaded on most new PCs, so it is found on most home computers.

There have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are:
- Windows 10 (released in 2015)
- Windows 8 (2012)
- Windows 7 (2009)
- Windows Vista (2007)

The name of the Windows OS comes from the fact that programs are run in “windows”: each program has its own window, and you can have several programs open at the same time.

<div align=center><h4>Linux</h4></div>

**Key Terms**
- **Linux**
- **Open-Source Software**
- **Kernel**
- **Distributions & GNU**
- **Bootloader**
- **Init System**
- **Daemons**
- **Graphical Server**
- **Desktop Environment**
- **Applications**

**Linux** is an operating system that was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Whether you want to learn IT or software development, Linux is a mainstay in the developer community as an operating system. The major difference between it and the Windows/Mac operating systems is that Linux is **open-sourced**. This means that Linux is completely free to download and use across as many computers that you own. What makes Linux open-sourced is the ability for any user to change its source code (which can be thought of as the exact rules for which an OS runs). There are pros and cons to having an open source operating system, which we will list here.

**Pros**
- Great for users that want to make changes to how their operating system works
- Open source is more developer-friendly
- Free to install on your computer(s)
- More secure as developers across the world have access to source code
- Any developer can offer code updates to be implemented to Linux
- Typically faster than Windows OS
- Works on computers with low system specifications

**Cons**
- Learning curve as Linux differs from other OS’s
- Certain applications do not work on Linux that might be specific to Mac or Windows
- Not many people use Linux for their computer’s operating system, as it’s most significant use today is for developers
- Not as user-friendly as Mac or Windows

Linux comes in many forms (seriously- there’s over 500!), called “**distributions**” or “distros” for short. What makes them all Linux operating systems is that they are based on the Linux kernel. Distros of Linux derive from either Debian or RPM, which are the two package managers for Linux distros. ***A typical Linux distribution consists of a*** <ins>***Linux kernel***</ins> ***and*** <ins>***GNU packages***</ins>.
