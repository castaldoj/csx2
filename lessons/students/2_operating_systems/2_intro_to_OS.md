<div align=center><h1>Software and Operating Systems</h1></div>

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the following concepts:

- What is software?
- What is an operating system?
- What are the core functions of an operating system?
- What are some examples of operating systems?

<div align=center><h2>What is Software</h2></div>

In the last lesson, we learned that computer systems consist of two major elements: hardware and software. In this lesson, you are going to learn about software.

**Software** is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. Opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer, software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device.

Software is often divided into two categories:

- System Software: operating systems and any program that supports application software.
- Application Software: user-downloaded programs that fulfill a want or need

<div align=center><h2>What is an Operating System?</h2></div>

Now that you understand how a computer works at a basic level, we will explore how an operating system makes hardware available to applications on the computer.

An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldnâ€™t function.

An operating system has three main functions:

1. Managing computer resources
2. Establishing user interfaces
3. Supporting applications software
