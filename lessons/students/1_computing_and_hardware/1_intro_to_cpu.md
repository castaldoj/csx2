### CPU
**Key Terms**
- Central Processing Unit (CPU): <!-- Insert Definition Here -->
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): <!-- Insert Definition Here -->
- Control Unit (CU): <!-- Insert Definition Here -->

Processors are the components that process and execute inputs received from hardware and software. This is also known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is thought of as the brain of the computer. It processes information and instructions from software running and other hardware components. CPUâ€™s can be found on the motherboard, and relies on other pieces of hardware such as chipsets to control the dataflow to and from other parts of the computer. Chipsets are groups of microchips located on the motherboard. There are two components that make up the CPU: the control unit and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). 

The control unit receives instructions from memory and then decodes the instructions into commands.

The ALU is a digital circuit inside the processor that handles arithmetic and logical operations.. After the control unit provides the ALU with the instruction on the operations that must be performed, the ALU is responsible for executing the commands from the control unit. The control unit then moves this data back to memory.
