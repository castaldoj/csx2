<div align=center><h1>Hardware and Computing</h1></div>

<div align=center><h2>The Purpose of this Section</h2></div>
The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the following concepts:

- What is hardware?
- What is a computer?
- What are the components of a computer?
- What is a Raspberry Pi?

<div align=center><h2>What is a Computer?</h2></div>

A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. The computer sees data as 1s and 0s, but it knows how to combine them to create much more complex things like photos, movies, websites, games, and much more.

Computers can be defined as any device that can:

1. Accept an input
2. Perform calculations based on that input
3. Provide an appropriate output

A computer system consists of two major elements, hardware and software. In this lesson, you are going to learn about hardware.

<div align=center><h2>What is Hardware?</h2></div>

**Hardware** refers to the physical elements that make up a computer. These are the <ins>components that you can physically touch.</ins>

Computers are composed of several hardware components. Some might be more familiar than others. In this lesson, you will learn to recognize some of the different components of a computer and begin to understand what they do.

<div align=center><h2>Core Components of a Computer</h2></div>

<div align=center><h3>1. Processer</h3></div>

#### Key Terms
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
- **Control Unit (CU)**

Processors are the components in computers that process and execute inputs received from hardware and software. This term can also be referenced as the Central Processing Unit. 

The CPU is thought of as the brain of the computer. 

<div class="mdImage">

</div>

We all know how the human brain works: it receives information, processes it, and responds to it by doing something. The CPU works in the same way. All of the inputs from the other parts of the computer are sent to the CPU, where it processes the information it receives and it sends the output as a response.

There are two components that make up the CPU, the **control unit** and the **arithmetic logic unit (ALU)**. 

The control unit is a digital circuit that directs operations within a computer's processor. The ALU is a <ins>digital circuit</ins> inside the processor that <ins>handles arithmetic and logical operations.</ins>

The following list describes how the control unit and the ALU work together to perform basic CPU functions:
1. First the control unit receives instructions from another part of the computer and decodes the instructions into commands. 
2. Then the control unit provides the ALU with these commands so that the ALU can execute them.
3. Finally the ALU returns information back to the control unit, and the control unit returns the data back to the other part of the computer.

Isn’t that process strangely familiar? First there is an input received, then a calculation is performed, and then an output is provided..Oh yeah! This is pretty much the same process described earlier in the lesson as the three basic functions of a computer. 

However, the question still remains: What component is performing that input and receiving that output? In the next section you will learn about memory.

<div align=center><h3>2. Memory</h3></div>

#### Key Terms
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**
- **Volatile Memory**

In computing, memory refers to the device that is used to store information for immediate use. Memory is the component within your computer that allows you to access data that is stored for a short term. 

While memory can refer to any medium of data storage, it usually refers to RAM, or **random access memory**. RAM is responsible for storing and accessing information it needs in the moment and in the near future. 

Some examples of operations that use RAM are:    
<div align=left>
<ul>
<li>Running your Operating System</li>
<li>Using applications</li>
</ul>
</div>
<span>
<div align=right>
<ul>
<li>Browsing the web</li>
<li>Editing documents or spreadsheets </li>
</ul>
</div>
</span>
RAM is an example of **volatile memory**. Volatile memory is a temporary form of memory that is <ins>lost when you turn off your computer.</ins>

<div>
Still trying to understand RAM? Let's think of our CPU as an engineer. The engineer can only have one tool in his hand at a time, but they need to be able to grab another tool when he needs it.

What does the engineer do? Luckily, they have a toolbelt called ‘RAM’ that is not as fast as whatever it is in hand but is still easily accessible.

When the engineer needs a tool that is not in hand nor their toolbelt, they have to go all the way back to the truck full of tools called the ‘Storage Drive’ (we will go over this in the next lesson). As you can tell, getting a tool from the truck is MUCH SLOWER than accessing the tools in their belt or in hand. 

So essentially the more RAM you have, the more stuff you can have on you without having to go to your storage drive when you need it. For this reason, the amount of memory you have installed on a computer plays a key role in how your system performs.

<div align=center><h3>3. Storage</h3></div>

**Key Terms**
- Hard Drive
- Non-Volatile Memory
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
- Solid State Drive (SSD)

Storage is the component of your computer that allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis.

Computer storage is considered non-volatile because it is capable of retaining saved data even without power. This means that information stored with **non-volatile storage** is not lost when you turn off your computer.

The following examples outline some of the more popular forms of computer storage:

##### Hard Disc Drive (HDD)
A **hard disk drive** is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital data using one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material.

<span class="mdImage">
    <img src="./images/hdd.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
</span>

**Pros:**
- Lower Price
- Better for long term storage

**Cons:**
- Slower Performance Speeds

##### Solid State Drive (SSD)
**Solid-state storage** is a type of non-volatile computer storage that stores and retrieves digital information using only electronic circuits, <ins>without any involvement of moving mechanical parts.<ins>

A **solid-state drive** is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory

<span class="mdImage">
    <img src="./images/ssd.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
</span>

**Pros:**
- Faster Performance Speeds
- Better for Day to Day Operations

**Cons:**
- More Costly
